Java Development Environment Setup -

TARGET : 
    !! Install JDK and configure development environment
    !! Successful Java compilation and execution.
    !! Installation steps and environment variables

Why I Did This
I needed to set up a proper Java development environment for my project (StudyManagementSystem). At first, I just wanted to run a simple HelloWorld.java ,but ended up learning how the whole Java setup works — including what JDK, JRE, and JVM actually are, and how easy it is to get the versions mixed up.

Understanding the Pieces
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The engine that runs Java code. It reads .class files (bytecode) and turns them into machine instructions.
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Includes the JVM and libraries needed to run Java programs — but not to compile them
- JDK (Java Development Kit): Includes everything in the JRE plus tools like javac, jar, and javadoc. Required for compiling and developing Java programs.

Step 1: Installing the JDK
I downloaded the latest LTS version of Java (JDK 21) from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows. 
After installation, my JDK was located here:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21

Step 2: Setting Environment Variables
1. Created JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21
2. Edited the Path variable and added: %JAVA_HOME%\bin

Step 3: Verifying the Setup
I ran:
java -version
javac -version
Both showed version 21, meaning everything was set correctly.

Step 4: Testing a Simple Program
I created HelloWorld.java:
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello WORLD");
    }
}

Then ran:
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld

It printed: Hello WORLD

The Problems I Faced (and Fixed)

1. javac not recognized
I had set JAVA_HOME but forgot to add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to PATH. Adding it and reopening the terminal fixed this.

2. Wrong command to run the class
I ran java HelloWorld.class (wrong). The correct command is java HelloWorld.

3. Compiled by a more recent version of Java Runtime
I compiled with JDK 21 but my system ran Java 8 JRE (1.8.0_251). I removed the old JRE path and ensured only JDK 21 remained in PATH.

4. The hidden javapath folder issue
Running 'where java' showed:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\javapath
This folder contained shortcuts to the old JRE. I deleted it from PATH and verified that java and javac both pointed to:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin

Final Check
After cleanup:
java -version
javac -version
Both show Java 21.

Lessons Learned
- JRE is for running programs, JDK is for development.
- PATH order matters when multiple Java versions are installed.
- The Oracle javapath folder can override new installations.
- Always verify versions using 'where java' and 'where javac'.

Current Working Setup
JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21
Path includes = %JAVA_HOME%\bin
java version = 21.0.1
javac version = 21.0.1

Everything now runs from the correct JDK. I can compile and run Java programs anywhere on my system, and I understand how each component (JDK, JRE, JVM) fits together.

Setup complete!
